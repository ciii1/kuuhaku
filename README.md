# Kuuhaku
Kuuhaku is a unified code formatting tool written in Go. 
It uses grammar configuration files to format various file formats. The configuration
file itself is in a custom extended LR(1) grammar format integrated with Lua.
The configuration file supports parameters for each rule definition and argument passing on the rule's usage.

## Documentation
